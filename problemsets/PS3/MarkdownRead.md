    #### We all more or less took each step at a time and thought about it as a group. Both the mathematical process and the coding process were taken into account. The matrix code came easier to us than the modification to the solve method, but what we came up with seemed to make the most sense because the first 2 parameters in all the solver methods were of the same types as the matrices that were being built in the build method for the MyChemicalDecayModel.
