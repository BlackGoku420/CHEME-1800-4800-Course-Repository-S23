## Lab 10d: The Flux Balance Analysis and the Dual Problem
In `Lab 10d` students will become familierzed with flux balance analysis applications in chemical engineering, and the interpretation of the dual problem in the context of flux balance analysis. 

### Background
Flux balance analysis (FBA) is an approach to estimate _flows_ through [trees and graphs](https://varnerlab.github.io/CHEME-1800-Computing-Book/unit-2-data/trees.html#trees), e.g., social graphs, communication networks, or other structures that can be represented as a network. Flux balance analysis is a type of a [maximum flow problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem). 

### Prerequisites
* `Lab-10d` requires that the [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) and [GLPK](https://github.com/jump-dev/GLPK.jl) packages be installed using the [Julia package manager included in the standard library](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/).

### Tasks
1. Start the Julia in the `Lab-10d` folder with the `--project=.` argument
1. Install required packages using the [Julia package manager](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/).
