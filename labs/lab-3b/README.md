## Lab-3b: Computing the Runtime of Bubble and Insertion Sort

### Objective
The objective of `lab-3b` is to give you practice with the understanding and the analyzing simple sorting algorithms [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) and [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort).

In `lab-3b` you will create lists of random numbers of different lengths and compute how long it takes to sort these lists using different sorting algorithms using the [BenchmarkTools](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl) package.
